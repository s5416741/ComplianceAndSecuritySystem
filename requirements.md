# Compliance and Security System Requirements

## 1. Threat Detection Requirements

### 1.1 Brute Force Attack Detection and Mitigation

- **Requirement**: The system must monitor login attempts handled by the Authentication microservice to detect brute force attacks and mitigate them.
  
- **Details**:
  - **Integration with Authentication Service**: Receive real-time logs and events from the Authentication microservice regarding failed login attempts.
  - **Login Attempt Limit**: Track failed login attempts per user/IP address, and if 5 failed attempts occur within 10 minutes, trigger a response.
  - **Account Locking via Authentication Service**: Instruct the Authentication microservice to lock the user account for 15 minutes after reaching the failed attempt limit.
  - **IP Blacklisting**: After 10 failed attempts from the same IP address within 30 minutes, the IP will be blacklisted for 1 hour.
  - **Notifications**: Send real-time notifications to administrators when suspicious login attempts are detected (configurable threshold).
  - **Logging**: Maintain a detailed audit log of all login attempts, including successful and failed attempts, to enable forensic analysis.

### 1.2 Suspicious Activity Detection

- **Requirement**: The system must detect and respond to suspicious patterns such as access from unusual locations or devices.
  
- **Details**:
  - **Unusual Location Detection**: Compare login attempts from different geographic regions, and trigger alerts if access is detected from multiple locations in a short period (e.g., accessing from New York and then from London within 30 minutes).
  - **Unusual Device or Browser Detection**: Track browser/device fingerprints and trigger an alert if a user logs in from an unrecognized device.
  - **Threshold Configuration**: Allow administrators to set thresholds for suspicious activity (e.g., number of locations, time between accesses).
  - **Real-Time Alerts**: Send alerts to administrators via email or push notifications when suspicious patterns are detected.
  - **Action**: Automatically trigger account re-verification (e.g., send a verification email) or require multi-factor authentication (MFA) upon detection of suspicious activity.

## 2. Compliance Enforcement Requirements

### 2.1 Data Protection Compliance (GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS)

- **Requirement**: The system must ensure compliance with data protection laws by monitoring data access and usage.
  
- **Details**:
  - **Access Logs**: Track all access to personal and sensitive data, including customer information, financial details, etc., ensuring audit logs are available for 12 months.
  - **Data Minimization**: Ensure only the necessary data is collected and processed in line with GDPRâ€™s data minimization principle.
  - **Encryption Enforcement**: Ensure all personal and sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and verify that the Authentication microservice encrypts user credentials properly.
  - **Right to Access and Erasure**: Provide APIs to fulfill user requests for accessing their data (right to access) and deleting their data (right to be forgotten) as mandated by GDPR/CCPA.
  - **Consent Management**: Verify that consent records are being captured and stored correctly, and ensure that any data processing (e.g., marketing, sharing) is only performed with explicit user consent.
  - **Breach Notification**: Implement mechanisms to detect data breaches and notify both administrators and affected users within the timeframes specified by GDPR and CCPA (72 hours for GDPR).

### 2.2 Audit Logging and Reporting

- **Requirement**: Maintain audit logs and generate compliance reports as required by law.
  
- **Details**:
  - **Audit Trail**: Log all access to sensitive data, configuration changes, and administrative actions (e.g., user access changes, permission modifications).
  - **Automated Compliance Reports**: Provide configurable reporting tools that generate compliance reports on-demand, showing system activity related to GDPR/CCPA compliance (e.g., data access, data deletion).
  - **Anomaly Reporting**: Generate and send periodic reports on suspicious activity, including login attempts, geographic access trends, and blacklisted IPs.
  - **Retention Policy**: Ensure that audit logs are stored securely and are retained in compliance with local regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS requires logs for a minimum of 12 months).

### 2.3 Third-Party Risk Management

- **Requirement**: Ensure that third-party services (e.g., the Authentication microservice) comply with data protection regulations.
  
- **Details**:
  - **Third-Party Compliance Checks**: Continuously monitor and log interactions with third-party services to ensure that they meet compliance standards for data protection.
  - **Vendor Risk Assessment**: Regularly assess third-party vendors for compliance with relevant regulations and track any risk they pose to data security.
  - **Contractual Compliance**: Enforce that third-party service agreements explicitly state their responsibility for data security and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR Data Processing Agreement).
